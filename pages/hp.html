					<h2>12th January 2025(Muscardine)</h2>
					<h3>Call with a former Silk cultivator :</h3>
					<p>
						On 12th January, 2025, a call with one of the stakeholders who was
						former silk cultivator was conducted. The cultivator had specified
						that this strain of the fungal muscadine will not happen in regions
						of madhya pradesh and northern india even though it is told to occur
						across all silk cultivations due to absence of heavy monsoon and
						waterlogging conditions. Hence the impact is reduced greatly hence
						we had to eliminate our project.

					<h2>(Lignin biodegradation)</h2>
					<h3>Conversation with sugarcane farm owner :</h3>

					<p>
						A discussion was held with a sugarcane farm owner, who primarily
						focuses on the cultivation and sale of sugarcane. While her
						expertise lay in commercial farming rather than research, she
						provided valuable industry insights and facilitated connections with
						relevant institutions. She shared contact details for Molychem Pvt.
						Ltd., a supplier of chemical reagents, and the ICAR-Sugarcane
						Breeding Institute, which specializes in sugarcane genetics and
						agronomic research. While neither institution focuses specifically
						on lignin extraction or utilization, Molychem Pvt. Ltd. could serve
						as a source for necessary reagents, and the ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding
						Institute may provide insights into sugarcane composition and
						related research areas.

					<h2>(Iron Toxicity in Paddy)</h2>
					<h3>Call with an environmental science student Ms. Brindha :</h3>
					<p>
						This discussion provided insights into the management of iron
						toxicity in rice. The student explained that the issue is typically
						addressed by adjusting soil pH, allowing crops to regulate iron
						uptake naturally. Since iron is a minor nutrient, addressing this
						problem on a large scale would have limited impact, as farmers often
						switch to iron-tolerant varieties like ADT 52 instead. Additionally,
						she noted that biosensors are rarely adopted by farmers, making them
						an impractical solution. She suggested alternative areas of
						research, including nanoplastic removal from soil and climate-smart
						agriculture. The osm-3 gene was referenced, which enhances
						osmoregulation and salinity tolerance, as a potential tool for
						improving crop resilience, though GMO adoption remains a challenge.
						Arsenic toxicity in rice was identified as a more significant
						concern, but existing microbial solutions necessitate a novel
						approach. Lastly, she highlighted that hydrogels are primarily used
						for drought-stress management, rather than for addressing iron
						toxicity.

					<h2>A Survey on Pepper Consumption</h2>
					<h3>
						A survey called “Salt without Pepper?” was conducted to understand
						the relevance of Pepper in domestic households and daily life.
					</h3>
					<p>
						As of 9th February,2025 (time 12:03 pm) we had 200 responses for the
						survey and the results of our survey were as follows:
					</p>
					<p>
						From the survey we gained insights into the go-to form of black
						pepper used by most of the consumers which was freshly ground at
						home. It gave us an approximate idea on how frequently it was used
						by consumers and the source from where they purchased it. 68.5% of
						the people hadn't heard of the disease and so this survey also
						served the purpose of spreading awareness of this disease in the
						general population. According to the numbers 77.5% of the people
						agree that the government or agricultural bodies should invest in
						protecting black pepper crops from diseases like foot rot.

					<h2>Future Plans for HP</h2>
					<h3>Contacting Ayurvedic doctors</h3>
					<p>
						Proposal to talk to Ayurvedic Doctors, to know more about Ayurveda
						about how Pepper has been used for medicinal purpouses since ancient
						times.
					</p>
					<h3>Enganging with black pepper farmers</h3>
					<p>
						We would conduct surveys and interviews with black pepper farmers in
						Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu to understand their challenges
						with P. capsici and get a general idea on how pepper cultivation is
						done. This would also tell us how we can implement our solution in
						fields.

					<h2>Future Collaborations</h2>
					<p>
						The Student Project Mars Rover Manipal of MIT have designed a more
						feasible flurometer during the year 2023-24. We propose to
						collaborate with them and inspire it in making a localized sensor
						for our detection method.

					<h2>SDGs</h2>
					<h3>SDG 2: Zero Hunger</h3>
					<p>
						The initiative decreases yield losses from
						<em>Phytophthora capsici</em> and other diseases and promotes
						sustainable agricultural production by employing microbial
						biocontrol agents. Maintaining a steady supply of high-value crops
						is ensured by managing black pepper infections.
					</p>
					<h3>SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being</h3>
					<p>
						Food may include toxic residues from fungicides used to control
						<em>P. capsici</em>. Utilising <em>Bacillus</em>-based biocontrol
						lowers the amount of hazardous substances people are exposed to.
					</p>
					<h3>SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</h3>
					<p>
						The project encourages the use of biological solutions for crop
						protection, reducing environmental contamination, by promoting
						biological disease management in place of synthetic fungicides.
						Healthier crops and improved disease resistance lead to lower crop
						losses, reducing overall food waste in black pepper production.
						Consumer awareness of sustainable farming by promoting
						<em>Bacillus</em> as a natural plant protection method.
					</p>
					<h3>SDG 13: Addressing Climate Change</h3>
					<p>
						Biocontrol techniques lessen reliance on chemical fungicides, whose
						manufacture uses a lot of energy thus reducing carbon footprint.
						Furthermore, by balancing the soil microbiome,
						<em>Bacillus</em> species lessen the demand for artificial
						fertilizers and improve soil quality.
					</p>
					<h3>SDG 15: Life on Land</h3>
					<p>
						While chemical pesticides have the potential to upset ecosystems,
						microbial biocontrol techniques solely target infections and do no
						harm to beneficial organisms. Long-term agricultural sustainability
						is ensured by preventing soil deterioration through the avoidance of
						excessive chemical use.
