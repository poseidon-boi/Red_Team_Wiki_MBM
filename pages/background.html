					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						<em>Phytophthora capsici</em> is a highly destructive oomycete
						pathogen that causes foot rot disease in black pepper (<em
							>Piper nigrum</em
						>), leading to severe economic losses in pepper-producing regions.
						Traditional management strategies have included chemical fungicides,
						cultural practices, and resistant cultivars that often fall short
						due to pathogen adaptability, environmental concerns, and resistance
						development [1].
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>Phytophthora</em> species are plant pathogens that use a
						combination of motility, attachment, and effector proteins to infect
						and suppress host immune responses. These pathogens produce
						biflagellated zoospores, which swim through water films to locate
						host plants before encysting and germinating. The infection process
						begins with the formation of appressoria, specialized structures
						that help penetrate plant tissues. Once inside,
						<em>Phytophthora</em> forms intercellular hyphae and haustoria,
						allowing it to extract nutrients and deliver effectors into the
						plant [1].
					</p>
					<p>
						To address this issue, we looked into the following before
						finalising our final solution to the project:
					</p>
				</article>

				<article id="article2">
					<h2>NLP Effectors</h2>
					<p>
						NLPs are a class of cytolytic effectors secreted by filamentous
						pathogens, including <em>P. capsici</em>. These proteins, such as
						NLP10, have been shown to induce necrosis and ethylene production,
						disrupting plant cell integrity. NLPs selectively target
						dicotyledonous plants, damaging their plasma membranes and causing
						cell death, which facilitates pathogen invasion. In
						<em>P. capsici</em>, NLP10 is thought to be involved in the early
						stages of infection, weakening host tissues before other effectors
						take over. In NCBI , the enymes are mostly searched upon the name
						“PcNLPX” where X denotes the number [7].
					</p>
				</article>
				<!-- <hr /> -->
				<article id="article3">
					<h2>Elicitins</h2>
					<p>
						Plays a dual role in <em>Phytophthora</em> pathogenicity and also
						acting cell death inducing proteins acting both as sterol-binding
						proteins essential for pathogen survival and as immune-modulating
						effectors. Since <em>Phytophthora</em> species cannot synthesize
						sterols, elicitins such as Capsicein from <em>P. capsici</em> bind
						host-derived sterols, supporting pathogen growth. Additionally, they
						may function as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that
						trigger plant immunity by activating systemic acquired resistance
						(SAR), hypersensitive response (HR), reactive oxygen species (ROS)
						production, and defense gene expression. Capsicein, a 10 kDa
						elicitin from <em>Phytophthora capsici</em>, triggers immune
						responses in non-host plants by interacting with NgRLK1, a
						receptor-like kinase in <em>Nicotiana glutinosa</em> [7].
					</p>
					<p>
						However, certain elicitins also act as virulence factors that
						suppress plant immunity, facilitating host colonization. Knockdown
						studies, such as the suppression of α-plurivorin in
						<em>P. plurivora</em>, have demonstrated that reducing elicitin
						expression weakens <em>Phytophthora</em> virulence, preventing
						infection in some hosts. Conversely, overexpression can either
						enhance plant resistance, as seen with PcINF1, or increase pathogen
						virulence, depending on the plant-pathogen interaction. Research
						indicates that PcINF1 interacts with the pepper protein SRC2-1, a
						receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase. This interaction is crucial for
						initiating immune responses in pepper plants. Additionally, the
						protein SGT1 has been found to be involved in the
						PcINF1/SRC2-1-induced immunity, suggesting a complex signaling
						pathway leading to defense responses [3][4].
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite their crucial roles, elicitins are not always essential for
						infection, as their primary function in some species is sterol
						acquisition rather than immune suppression.
					</p>
				</article>
				<!-- <hr /> -->
				<article id="article4">
					<h2>RxLR Effectors</h2>
					<p>
						Another major class of effectors used by <em>P. capsici</em> is the
						RxLR (Arginine-any amino acid-Leucine-Arginine) family. These
						effectors function by entering plant cells and directly interfering
						with host immunity. F RXLR effectors from <em>P. capsici</em> has
						been found to target and inhibit central immune kinases, preventing
						the activation of immune responses. This allows
						<em>P. capsici</em> to evade detection and continue its infection
						cycle without being attacked by the plant's defense system [10].

					<h2>Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a Decoy Receptor</h2>
					<p>
						<em>Phytophthora capsici</em> deploys RXLR-class effectors that
						enter plant cells and manipulate host immunity and plant resistance.
						One such effector, PcAvh1, has been found to target Protein
						Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a crucial regulator of plant defense
						signaling. By binding to PP2A, PcAvh1 suppresses plant immune
						responses, making the host more susceptible to infection. We ran the
						NCBI databases to check if the PP2A is expressed by any bacteria. We
						couldn't find any and thus resorted to finding an alternative to the
						PP2A called PrPE that was said to be structurally similar and
						functional to PP2A through literature review. The PrPE was expressed
						or produced by the ori yjbP gene from
						<em>Bacillus subtilis</em> 168. The sequence of PP2A and PrPE was
						aligned in Pymol to find if they are structurally similar. We docked
						the RXLR receptors and PrPE to check the binding affinity.
						Unfortunately the docking results were not favourable and thus had
						to eliminate the idea [9].

					<h2>PcAvh1-Triggered Antifungal Compound Production</h2>
					<p>
						<em>Phytophthora capsici</em> deploys RXLR-class effectors that

					<h3>a. β-1,3-Glucanase:</h3>
					<p>
						β-1,3-glucanase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes β-1,3-glucans, a major
						structural component of the <em>Phytophthora capsici</em> cell wall.
						Since <em>P. capsici</em> contains more β-1,3-glucans compared to
						true fungi (which have higher chitin content), this enzyme weakens
						its cell wall, reducing virulence or causing cell lysis [11].
					</p>
					<h3>b. Sphingolipid-Targeting Compounds:</h3>
					<p>
						Sphingolipids are vital components of <em>P. capsici</em> cell
						membranes, essential for maintaining cellular integrity and
						signaling. Targeting sphingolipids can disrupt these critical
						functions, weakening the pathogen. For instance, a compound called
						2E,4E-decadienoic acid, produced by a coculture of
						<em>Bacillus subtilis</em> and <em>Trichoderma asperellum</em>,
						exhibited a 94.21% inhibition rate against pathogens. Although the
						exact producer remains unidentified, this strategy highlights the
						potential for novel antifungal agents [12].
					</p>
					<h3>c. Iturin A :</h3>
					<p>
						Iturin A is a lipopeptide antibiotic produced by
						<em>Bacillus subtilis</em> that exhibits potent antifungal activity.
						It disrupts fungal cell membranes by forming pores, leading to ion
						leakage and cell death. Its mechanism of action targets the lipid
						bilayer, making it highly effective against a wide range of fungal
						pathogens, including <em>Phytophthora capsici</em>. By compromising
						the integrity of the pathogen's cell membrane, Iturin A weakens
						<em>P. capsici</em>'s virulence and contributes to its suppression.
					</p>
					<p>
						These compounds are naturally produced by <em>B. subtilis</em> are
						engineered for inducible expression, activated only by when PcAvh1
						is detected. The response regulator (activated via TCS) binds to an
						engineered promoter that controls antifungal biosynthesis genes.
						Upon PcAvh1 binding, antifungal production is induced, along
						expression.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since the Plant Cells also contain glucan and Iturin A is broad
						spectrum, it could induce plant cell death on usage of
						β-1,3-Glucanase. Iturin A is broad spectrum antifungal , since the
						main mode of infection occurs in the roots, injecting an antifungal
						could cause the beneficial fungi to also perish thus collapsing the
						fungal or microbiotic ecosystem.
