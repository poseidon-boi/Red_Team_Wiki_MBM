					<h2>Impact and vision</h2>
					<p>
						Foot rot, caused by <em>Phytophthora capsici</em> , is a significant
						disease affecting black pepper (<em>Piper nigrum L.</em> )
						cultivation, leading to substantial yield and economic losses
						globally. The impact of this disease varies across different regions
						and is influenced by factors such as environmental conditions and
						management practices. In India, particularly in the states of
						Karnataka and Kerala, foot rot is recognized as a major constraint
						in black pepper production. A survey conducted in the Shivamogga and
						Chickmagaluru districts of Karnataka reported disease incidences
						ranging from 50% to 65% in certain villages, leading to significant
						yield reductions [1].
					</p>
					<p>
						Another survey in Karnataka revealed varying disease incidences
						across districts, with the highest mean incidence of 18.44% recorded
						in Hassan district. Foot rot incidence was notably higher during the
						2017 growing season (16.38%) compared to the previous year (14.35%).
						The disease typically causes a 5-20% loss of vines, but in some
						individual gardens, losses can reach up to 95%.
						<a href="https://ndpublisher.in/admin/issues/IJAEBv13n1i.pdf">[2]</a
						>. In Kerala, studies have estimated annual yield losses due to foot
						rot ranging from 3.4% to 9.4%. For instance, between 1982 and 1985,
						Calicut and Kannur districts reported losses of 119 and 905 tonnes
						of black pepper, respectively, attributed to this disease
						<a
							href="https://updatepublishing.com/journal/index.php/josac/article/view/4393/3892"
							>[3]</a
						>. On a global scale, <em>Phytophthora capsici</em> is a major
						threat to black pepper cultivation, with varying incidences reported
						in different countries. In Vietnam, foot rot is considered the most
						devastating disease of black pepper, leading to annual crop losses
						ranging from 5% to 95%. The disease incidence is highest during the
						period from May to November [4]. In Indonesia, foot rot has caused a
						degradation of pepper production from 5% to 0%, with yield declines
						reaching up to 30% to 40% in some gardens, and in severe cases, it
						can devastate 100% of the crop [5]. Similarly, in Malaysia, more
						than 95% of pepper farms are infected with <em>P. capsici</em>,
						leading to a 5% to 10% decrease in productivity [6].
					</p>
					<p>
						The disease is not limited to Southeast Asia but is also a concern
						in other parts of the world, including the Americas, Europe, Africa,
						and Australia. Foot rot affects solanaceous and cucurbitaceous
						plants, often leading to complete crop loss. Researchers have noted
						that foot rot disease can lead to rapid and devastating crop
						failure, especially under conducive environmental conditions [7]. On
						a global scale, foot rot has been associated with annual crop losses
						estimated between $4.5 million and $7.5 million. In countries like
						Vietnam, losses due to quick wilt have been estimated to range from
						15-20%, resulting in an average yield loss of 30-50%

					<h2>Life cycle of <em>P.capsici</em></h2>
					<p>
						<em> P. capsici</em> reproduces by both sexual and asexual means.
						The pathogen produces two mating types called A1 and A2. Each mating
						type produces hormones responsible for gametangia differentiation in
						the opposite mating type.<em>P. capsici</em> produces a female
						gametangium called oogonium and a male gametangium called the
						antheridium. Meiosis occurs within the gametangia resulting in the
						of oospores. These are the sexual spores that can germinate either
						directly through the formation of a germ tube or indirectly through
						sporangium. This pathogen also reproduces asexually by sporangia.
						Sporangia are generally ovoid and consist of a papillum at their
						apex. Sporangia germinate to produce zoospores which help in the
						infection of host cells
						<a href="https://doi.org/10.1094/pdis.1999.83.12.1080">[9]</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Infection Cycle : </strong>
						If the conditions are favourable the <em>P. capsici</em> produces
						many sporangia. During irrigation events, mature sporangia release
						motile zoospores. These zoospores are negatively geotropic (against
						gravity or upwards) and swim chemotactically towards plants. Once
						these zoospores reach the surface of the plant, they penetrate the
						host cell by the appressorium to form intercellular hyphae. This
						intracellular hyphae is also called an infection vesicle. This
						infection vesicle further matures to form haustorium. It then
						secretes effectors like RxLRs and CRNs. These effectors inhibit key
						plant protease namely Phytophthora Inhibited Protease (PIP1) Hevea
						brasiliensis serine protease (HbSPA) soybean aspartic
						protease(GMAP1) soybean glucanase (GMGIP1)

					<h2>Current strategies</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>1. Chemical Fungicides :</strong>
						Chemical fungicides are commonly used for managing
						<em>Phytophthora capsici</em> infection in black pepper. Treatments
						with a variety of commercial fungicides, such as Sectin (Fenamidone
						+ Mancozeb), Acrobat Mz (Dimethomorph + Mancozeb), Curzate M8
						(Cymoxanil + Mancozeb), and Kocide (Copper hydroxide), have shown
						significant efficacy in reducing disease severity. Studies have
						demonstrated that the application of Fenamidone + Mancozeb and
						Copper hydroxide resulted in up to 78% reduction in disease
						intensity compared to untreated control plants, with the best
						results observed in the 2013-2014 season [11]. Despite their
						effectiveness, chemical fungicides have limitations, such as the
						development of resistance and environmental concerns like copper
						accumulation in soil and toxicity to beneficial microorganisms [12].
						Repeated application of these fungicides is often necessary to
						maintain effectiveness, and resistance to certain fungicides, such
						as metalaxyl, has already been documented in India and globally
						[13].
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>2. Biological Control Agents :</strong>
						In recent years, biological control agents have been explored as an
						alternative or supplement to chemical fungicides. Organisms such as
						<em>Trichoderma harzianum</em> and <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> have
						shown promise in controlling <em>Phytophthora capsici</em> in
						laboratory settings, often reducing disease by 50-70%. However,
						field efficacy has been inconsistent due to environmental
						variability, such as moisture levels and microbial competition [14].
						One biopesticide approach involving a consortium of plant
						growth-promoting microorganisms (PGPM) has shown moderate success,
						with disease reduction rates of around 24.3% in some trials, which
						is significantly better than untreated controls [15]. Despite these
						promising results, biological control agents require precise timing
						and application methods to be effective and have limited activity
						against specific life stages of <em>Phytophthora capsici</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>3. Resistant Pepper Varieties :</strong>
						Another strategy involves using resistant pepper cultivars, such as
						Pusa Jwala and IISR Avinash, which offer partial resistance to
						<em>Phytophthora capsici</em>. These varieties can delay infection
						but do not provide complete immunity. Resistance can break down
						under high pathogen pressure or with new
						<em>Phytophthora</em> strains. Furthermore, farmers often prefer
						high-yielding varieties that may not possess adequate resistance
						[16]. Breeding programs for developing resistant varieties are slow,
						often taking 5-10 years per cultivar, and may not offer a quick
						solution to the problem.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong> 4. Cultural Practices :</strong>
						Cultural practices such as raised beds, crop rotation, and soil
						solarization are used to reduce disease incidence. Raised beds help
						with drainage and prevent root rot, while crop rotation can help
						break the pathogen's lifecycle. However, these practices are not
						curative and are labor-intensive, making them less feasible for
						smallholder farmers with limited resources [17]. While they can
						reduce disease incidence, they do not completely eliminate
						soil-borne inoculum, and their effectiveness can be affected by
						weather conditions, such as heavy rains that may negate drainage
						efforts [18].
