					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						Our iGEM project has been shaped through discussions with farmers, researchers, industry professionals, and academic experts which helped us critically assess various project ideas, considering feasibility, impact, and real-world application. These conversations provided valuable insights into agricultural challenges, existing solutions, and the practical constraints that influence technology adoption. By integrating this feedback, we were able to refine our direction, ultimately focusing on a problem where we could provide a meaningful and viable solution using synthetic biology.

					<h2>MUSCARDINE DISEASE IN SILK WORMS</h2>
					
					<h3><strong>Call with a former Silk cultivator:
				</strong></h3>
				<p> 		
						On 12th January, 2025, a call with one of the stakeholders who was former silk cultivator was conducted. The cultivator had specified that this strain of the fungal muscadine will not happen in regions of madhya pradesh and northern india even though it is told to occur across all silk cultivations due to absence of heavy monsoon and waterlogging conditions. Hence the impact is reduced greatly and thus we had to eliminate our project.

					<h2>LIGNIN BIODEGRADATION</h2>
					<h3><strong>
						Conversation with sugarcane farm owner:
					</strong></h3>
					<p>
						A discussion was held on the 18th of January, 2025 with a sugarcane farm owner, who primarily focuses on the cultivation and sale of sugarcane. While her expertise lay in commercial farming rather than research, she provided valuable industry insights and facilitated connections with relevant institutions. She shared contact details for Molychem Pvt. Ltd., a supplier of chemical reagents, and the ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute, which specializes in sugarcane genetics and agronomic research. While neither institution focuses specifically on lignin extraction or utilization, Molychem Pvt. Ltd. could serve as a source for necessary reagents, and the ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute may provide insights into sugarcane composition and related research areas.

					<h2>IRON TOXICITY IN PADDY</h2>
					
					<h3><strong>Call with an environmental science student Ms. Brindha:
				</strong></h3>
				<p> 		
					This discussion provided insights into the management of iron toxicity in rice. The student explained that the issue is typically addressed by adjusting soil pH, allowing crops to regulate iron uptake naturally. Since iron is a minor nutrient, addressing this problem on a large scale would have limited impact, as farmers often switch to iron-tolerant varieties like ADT 52 instead. Additionally, she noted that biosensors are rarely adopted by farmers, making them an impractical solution. She suggested alternative areas of research, including nanoplastic removal from soil and climate-smart agriculture. The osm-3 gene was referenced, which enhances osmoregulation and salinity tolerance, as a potential tool for improving crop resilience, though GMO adoption remains a challenge. Arsenic toxicity in rice was identified as a more significant concern, but existing microbial solutions necessitate a novel approach. Lastly, she highlighted that hydrogels are primarily used for drought-stress management, rather than for addressing iron toxicity.
					</p>
					<h3><strong>First call with Mr. Vijayan Valachi, a retired Government Agriculture Officer, Kannur district:
					</strong></h3>
					<p>
						The conversation held on 19th January, 2025 provided insights into soil management and iron toxicity. The Officer explained that acidic soils affect multiple crops, including rice, coconut, and vegetables. Farmers commonly use 600 kg of liming material per hectare (₹12/kg) to raise the soil pH to 7-7.5, though over-liming can push it to 8. During the rainy season, waterlogging leads to a brown surface layer, indicating increased acidity. He noted that microorganisms are primarily used for pest control, not for soil compound detection, and was unfamiliar with biosensors. Regarding hydrogels, he confirmed they are not commonly used in the region but suggested they could protect microbial strains from waterlogging—though potential dissolution in water remains a concern. He also mentioned that borate and magnesium are incorporated into fertilizers to mitigate iron toxicity. Finally, he emphasized that if a product were to be developed, its cost must remain competitive with liming material to ensure adoption by farmers.

							style="max-height: 60vh" />
						
					<p> 
						This call was on the 31st of January, 2025. Mr. Vijayan told us about how in the transplantation stage if iron toxicity is prevalent, yield losses could go up to 60-80%. He also mentioned that the toxicity is most abundant in stagnant water and is seen as bronzy deposits or a film on the water surface. He elaborated on the soil composition that facilitates iron toxicity. He told us about how liming is the primary solution for this problem. Application of liming was 350Kg before planting and 250 Kg a month after planting. Iron toxicity has always been a problem as the parent soil is acidic in nature in most of Kerala, except for Palakkad and Chittoor, which is alkaline. He told us about how toxicity symptoms were gone after a week of the initial lime application and that the plant was restored back to health. Some disadvantages of the liming process was its cost intensive nature and the fact that it was not a permanent solution as repeated application was required. Since our proposed solution did not meet the required feasibility criteria, we eliminated this project.

					<h2>AVIAN FLU IN DUCKS</h2>
					
					<h3><strong>First conversation with Assistant Professor Archana Mahadev Rao:
				</strong></h3>
				<p> 		
					The discussions held on the 15th January, 2025 highlighted key challenges in viral detection. Exposed RNA decays quickly, requiring stabilization or detection within the capsid. Hemagglutinin's conservation needed verification. Introducing another organism was unnecessary, and breaking host cells raised biosafety concerns. Antibody based detection was costly, favoring enzyme based methods. Nuclease based detection required ensuring the target sequence was absent in the duck genome. Primer costs and hypothetical proteins were also considered. High mutation rates complicated the identification of conserved regions. Conserved nucleases and RNA dependent RNA polymerase were prioritized, though establishing novelty remained challenging due to advancements in human viral detection.
					</p>
					<h3><strong>Second conversation with Assistant Professor Archana Mahadev Rao:
					</strong></h3>
					<p>
						This conversation with Archana ma'am on the 22nd of January, 2025 entailed mainly qualms on feasibility. She asked us to change strains to bacterial strains for ease of use and to ensure compliance of BSL levels that we can use. She also asked us to reverse engineer the ideation process, that is to look into ELISA type biosensors first, then find a target organism, then arrive at our problem statement. 
					</p>
					<h3><strong>Conversation with Mr. Anantha Ramakrishnan, Director of Quality systems, Biocon Biologics:
					</strong></h3><figure class="right">
						<img
							src="../images/avianflu.jpg"
							alt="Picture"
							style="max-height: 30vh" />
					</figure>
					<p>
						A call was conducted on the 25th of January, 2025 during which valuable insights were gained into the challenges of tackling viral infections. It was emphasized that the high mutation rate of viruses presents a significant hurdle, particularly when working with RNA, where stability is a critical factor. Additionally, it was pointed out that developing a detection method that identifies the virus only after infection has occurred, especially if results take up to a week, would offer little to no benefit to the duck, as timely intervention is crucial for effective disease management.

					<h2>PEPPER FOOT ROT</h2>
					
					<h3><strong>Call with Mr. Venkatesh Rao, Horticulture specialist (Ankith's grandfather):
				</strong></h3>
				<p> 		
					In the conversation with Mr. Venkatesh Rao, a Horticulture Specialist at Varsha Enterprises on the 3rd of February, he emphasized the severity of Black Pepper Foot Rot, particularly during the monsoon season. He noted that the disease is widespread in plantations across Karnataka, especially in regions like Puttur, Hebri, and Hassan, as well as in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. To gain a deeper understanding and explore possible solutions, he recommended reaching out to local enterprises that specialize in Pepper cultivation and getting in touch with the Pepper Research Station in Panniyoor, Kerala.

					<p> 					<h3><strong>Nursery visit and discussion with Mr. Rakesh Kumar Rao:
					</strong></h3>
					<p>
						On the 6th of February, 2025, we visited a nursery owned by Mr. Rakesh Kumar Rao, Founder and CEO of Sthapana Agro Tech and Farms and Veg, and spoke to him about diseases affecting Pepper crops and the specific varieties most vulnerable to them. He provided valuable insights into common pathogens, their symptoms, and prevention methods, emphasizing the role of environmental conditions, soil quality, and farming practices in disease susceptibility. He also shared documents detailing disease identification, treatment strategies, and best practices for maintaining healthy crops. As he had to attend to urgent work at the nursery, our conversation was brief, but he assured us he would share more resources if needed. Before we left, he mentioned local farmers experimenting with alternative pest control methods and encouraged us to explore those approaches.					</p>
